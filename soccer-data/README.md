##About this Dataset

International football results from 1872 to 2017
A dataset of nearly 40,000 international football results

###Context

Well, basically what happened was I was looking for a semi-definite easy to read list of international football matches and couldn't find anything decent. So I took it upon myself to collect it for my own use. I might as well share it.

###Content

This dataset includes 38,361 results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1972 up to 2017. The matches range from World Cup to Baltic Cup to regular friendly matches. The matches are strictly men's full internationals and the data does not include Olympic Games or matches where at least one of the teams was the nation's B-team, U-23 or a league select team.

results.csv includes the following columns:

###Acknowledgements

The data is gathered from several sources including but not limited to wikipedia, fifa.com, rsssf.com and individual football associations' websites.
